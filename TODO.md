- [ ] Make note transition smoother

- [ ] Tempo modulation
- [ ] Check [this repository](https://github.com/andyherbert/ansiterm/tree/main/basic_waves/src) to implement different wave form, kind of kickstart the implementation of different instruments. I have authorization to use part of the code.
